### Steps to run

- clone repository.
- navigate to `/app` directory.
- ensure npm is installed & open a terminal in `/app`.
- run in terminal `npm install` .
- run in terminal `npm run start` .

### General Todos:
- Switch from useState hooks for managing the individual colours of pixels to using a global useState (possibly Redux). This is to prevent multiple updates for all the pixels per grid update.
